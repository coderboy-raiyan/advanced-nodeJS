## Request Object

- In Request Object we have many things to work with But there some of are important example :-
  - req.url → for get the url from the client
  * req.method → for get the method from the client
  * req.headers → for see the headers are send By the client

## Response Object

- By using response we can send user a response which can be html/json and so on example :-
  - res.setHeader → By using this we can set Header on client browser
  - res.write → using this write we can write our text on the response for the user
  - res.end → By using this after write the response we need to end it otherwise our response will be finished
